      1.0.1:
      - Added support for synchronous requests sent to the server.
      - Using this mode with the simulator always makes the request to timeout as the server tries to access the application main thread already waiting an answer.
      Synchronous requests can't therefore be used against the local server within the same simulator instance, but can be used if using 2 simulator instances communicating with each other.
      This is not a bug, the simulator done like that and modifying it is not the subject. You can still run 2 simulator instances to test these synchrounous requests.

      1.0.0:
      - Creation
